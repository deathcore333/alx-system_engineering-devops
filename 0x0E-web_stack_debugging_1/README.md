Network basics:
Network basics refer to the fundamental concepts, components, and protocols of computer networking. These include the different types of network topologies, network devices, network protocols, and network services.

Web stack debugging:
Web stack debugging is the process of troubleshooting and resolving issues that occur in the various layers of the web stack, which includes the web server, application server, database server, and other components. This process involves identifying the root cause of the issue, debugging the code, and implementing a fix. Common tools used for web stack debugging include log files, network analysis tools, and debugging tools.

In a web stack, each layer depends on the layer beneath it to function properly. For example, the web server relies on the application server to execute the code and on the database server to retrieve and store data. If one of these layers fails to function properly, it can cause issues in the entire web stack.

Effective web stack debugging requires a thorough understanding of the underlying technologies and protocols, as well as experience in troubleshooting issues that arise in different layers of the web stack.
