Web Infrastructure Whiteboards
This repository contains a collection of whiteboards illustrating various types of web infrastructure. The whiteboards are designed to help developers and engineers understand the different components that make up a web stack, from the simplest setups to more complex distributed architectures, as well as how to build a secured and monitored web infrastructure.

Simple Web Stack
The first set of whiteboards illustrate a simple web stack, which typically consists of a web server, a database server, and a client browser. The web server receives HTTP requests from the client browser, processes them, and sends back HTTP responses. The database server stores data that the web server needs to respond to the client's requests.

Distributed Web Stack
As web applications grow and require more resources to handle incoming traffic, a distributed web stack can help to scale the application horizontally. The whiteboards in this section illustrate how a distributed web stack can be architected using load balancers, multiple web servers, and multiple database servers.

Distributed Web Stack

Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
A secured and monitored web infrastructure is essential to protect against security threats and to ensure that the web application is running smoothly. The whiteboards in this section illustrate how firewalls, SSL certificates, and monitoring tools can be used to create a secured and monitored web infrastructure.
