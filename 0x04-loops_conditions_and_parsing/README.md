Loops, conditions and parsing are fundamental concepts in computer programming that allow developers to control the flow of execution of their programs.



Loops are structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. There are two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.



Conditions are structures that allow you to make decisions in your code based on whether a certain condition is met. If a condition is met, a block of code is executed; otherwise, another block of code is executed.



Parsing refers to the process of analyzing and breaking down data into its smaller components, so that it can be easily processed by a computer program. It is often used to extract information from strings or files.



In combination, loops, conditions and parsing allow programmers to manipulate data, automate repetitive tasks and make their programs more flexible and dynamic.
