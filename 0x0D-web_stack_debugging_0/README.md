Web Stack Debugging
This repository contains exercises related to web stack debugging, a critical skill for anyone working with web applications.

Network Basics
Understanding the basics of networking is essential when working with web applications, particularly in a distributed environment such as Docker containers. Here are some key concepts:

IP Address
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device connected to a network. It consists of a series of numbers separated by dots, such as 192.168.0.1. IP addresses can be either public or private, with public addresses being used for devices that are accessible from the internet and private addresses being used for devices on a local network.

Port
A port is a number that is used to identify a specific application or service running on a device. Ports are used to allow multiple applications to run on a single device, with each application communicating through its own port.

Protocol
A protocol is a set of rules that governs how data is transmitted over a network. The two most common protocols used for web applications are HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure). HTTP is used for standard web pages, while HTTPS is used for secure web pages that require encryption.

DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) is a service that translates domain names (such as google.com) into IP addresses that can be used to locate a specific device on a network. DNS is critical for web applications, as it allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names rather than complex IP addresses.

Docker
Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows applications to be run in isolated environments known as containers. Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and can be easily deployed across different environments.

Some of the benefits of using Docker include:

Simplified deployment process
Consistent development and production environments
Resource isolation
Better scalability and availability
However, working with Docker also requires a solid understanding of networking concepts, such as ports and IP addresses, as well as how to troubleshoot network-related issues.
